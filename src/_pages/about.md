<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](h  ttps://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


I'm a **Software Developer** and **R&D Crew Lead** with a solid background in project design and management. My experience includes
leading **AI projects**, **backend systems**, creating features that can run in real-time, and handling **complex tasks** with ease. 
I've also set up AI/ML operations, built automation systems, and developed apps for desktop,cloud, and web. 

Through my work, I've learned enough to bring my individual products to life. I'm always looking
to use the **latest tech** to improve my work. In every project, I try to bring something new to the table, combining
my technical skills with fresh ideas. I like to think outside the box and make things that stand out. **"Be different"** is
my way of doing things.
