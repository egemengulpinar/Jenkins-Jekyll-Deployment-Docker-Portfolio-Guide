<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](h  ttps://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


I am an AI Engineer, Backend Developer, and R&D Crew Lead with hands-on experience in designing, managing, and maintaining AI projects. I have led multiple **AI projects**, built real-time detection systems and complex systems with multiple processes, and set up **AI/ML workflows**.

 In addition, I've built **automation systems** and **backend services**, have experience in creating **desktop**, **cloud**, and **web apps**. In all my work, I'm always looking for ways to include the latest advancements in AI. Beyond my technical roles, I'm an Indie Hacker who loves to think differently and **find unique solutions**. My belief is that continuous learning is key in the fast-changing world of AI and I like to combine what I have learnt with the ideas I have in my mind. My motto is always **"be different"**.
